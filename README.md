This project demonstrates the implementation of a **DevSecOps pipeline** for a simple **Tic Tac Toe** game built with modern web technologies. The pipeline integrates **development, security, and operations** practices to ensure code quality, security compliance, and smooth deployment.

## Features

- 🎮 Fully functional Tic Tac Toe game  
- 📊 Score tracking for X, O, and draws  
- 📜 Game history with timestamps  
- 🏆 Highlights winning combinations  
- 🔄 Reset game and statistics  
- 📱 Responsive design for all devices  
- 🔐 DevSecOps integration for secure CI/CD  

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS  
- **Icons:** Lucide React  
- **DevSecOps Tools (examples):**
  - GitHub Actions / GitLab CI for CI/CD  
  - ESLint, Prettier for code quality  
  - Snyk / Dependabot for dependency security  
  - Docker for containerization  
  - SonarQube for code scanning

## Game Logic

- X goes first, followed by O  
- First player to get 3 marks in a row wins  
- If all 9 squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw  
- Winning combinations are highlighted  
- Game statistics are tracked and displayed

## DevSecOps Pipeline Overview

This project integrates **DevSecOps best practices**:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**  
   - Run unit tests and linting on each commit  
   - Automatic code formatting with Prettier  

2. **Security Scanning**  
   - Static code analysis (SonarQube)  
   - Dependency vulnerability checks (Snyk/Dependabot)  

3. **Continuous Delivery (CD)**  
   - Automated deployment to staging/production environments  
   - Dockerized deployment for consistency  

4. **Monitoring & Logging**  
   - Real-time monitoring of deployed application  
   - Logging for troubleshooting and auditing
