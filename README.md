# SecureFlow

This project is a **Tic Tac Toe game** implemented as a web application. It allows players to enjoy the classic game, automatically track their scores, and view a history of past matches. The entire application is built using modern *web development tools*, packaged into *Docker containers* for portability, and deployed with *Kubernetes* through an *automated CI/CD pipeline* to ensure reliable delivery and operation.
